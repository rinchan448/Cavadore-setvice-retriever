        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why I Created the Cavadore Service Retriever</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          For years, I worked with service dogs and saw a gap — many people needed the intelligence, focus, and trainability of a Golden Retriever, but in a smaller, easier-to-handle size.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          There are many wonderful small breeds, but it can be difficult to find one with the stable, dependable temperament of a Golden Retriever. Some toy-sized breeds are simply too tiny to safely navigate busy public environments, where they risk being stepped on or run over by carts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cavadore Service Retriever bridges that gap — large enough to work confidently in public, yet small enough to live comfortably in any home or travel setting. By combining the gentle, people-focused temperament of the Golden Retriever, the soft expression and size of the Cocker Spaniel, and select traits from other small companion breeds, I created a dog under 30 pounds — without sacrificing brains, biddability, or work ethic.
